# BTech-Major-Project-2025
5G mobility simulation project that models and analyzes seamless handover mechanisms using OMNeT++, including signal strength tracking, handover triggering logic, and performance impactÂ analysis.

# 5G Handover Simulation using Simu5G

This repository contains the implementation of a project titled:  
*"Simulation and Evaluation of Seamless Handover Mechanism in 5G Networks using Simu5G Framework"*  
developed as part of our final year major project at [Your Institution Name].

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project demonstrates a realistic simulation of User Equipment (UE) mobility and handover between 5G base stations (gNBs) using the *Simu5G framework* built on top of *OMNeT++* and *INET*.

The objective is to evaluate:
- Signal strength degradation as UE moves away from a serving cell
- Threshold-based handover triggering using hysteresis
- Performance impact during and after handovers (throughput, delay, etc.)

## ðŸ§  Key Features

- Threshold + Hysteresis-based Handover Decision Algorithm
- Mobility simulation using LinearMobility module
- Signal strength monitoring (RSSI logs)
- Custom .ned and .ini files for scenario definition
- Post-simulation graph generation using Python (optional)

---

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- *OMNeT++* (v5.6.2 or later)
- *Simu5G Framework*
- *INET Framework*
- *C++ & NED language*
- *Python (matplotlib, pandas)* for performance graphing
